Welcome to the **Intro to Cloud** course! By the end of this workshop, you'll understand key cloud concepts, gain hands-on experience deploying a full stack application to the cloud, 
and confidently discuss terms related to cloud and CICD practices. 


## üìù Summary

Here's what you'll learn:

- What the **cloud** is (and what it isn't)
- Benefits of cloud computing
- Introduction to major **cloud providers**
- Hands-on experience with **CI/CD**
- How to deploy a **static front-end app** to the cloud
- What is docker 
- Benefits of using docker
- Introduction to **EC2** instances

## Course Completion Requirements
- Attendance:  
    - An 80% attendance rate is expected. Students must inform the instructor of any planned absence. 
    - Students who miss two consecutive sessions without prior notification to the instructor will be considered dropped from the course. 
- Final Assessment: one-on-one meeting with an instructor
    - Students will be required to show that they have set up the AWS services covered throughout the course. 
    - Students will answer a few "interview" questions to show that they can discuss what they've learned and use the vocabulary correctly. We are not expecting mastery just a basic understanding of the concepts.

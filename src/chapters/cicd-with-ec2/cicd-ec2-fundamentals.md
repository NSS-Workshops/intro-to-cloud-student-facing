## Upgrading from Simple Workflows to Production-Ready CI/CD

In our earlier CI/CD workflow, we kept things simple — run tests whenever code changes, using GitHub Actions and your raw application environment.

Check out the [CI/CD Fundamentals]( ./cicd-fundamentals) from the first workshop for a refresher.

In this chapter, we take a **big step forward**:  separating responsibilities, containerizing the app, and introducing manual deployment control. These additions reflect what you’ll find in real-world engineering teams and production systems.


### 🧱 Job Separation

Instead of one big job that builds, tests, and deploys, we will now use **two distinct jobs**:

- One to run tests  
- One to build and push the Docker image


This separation gives us:

- ✅ **Better visibility**
- 🔁 **Rerun only what’s needed**
- 🚨 **Early failure detection**
- 🧩 **More flexibility**


### 🖱️ Manual Deployment Workflow

We also introduce a **manual GitHub Actions workflow** to deploy to EC2 via **AWS Systems Manager (SSM)**.

Benefits:
- ✅ Doesn’t require SSH or open ports
- ✅ Safer and auditable
- ✅ Only deploy when ready — ideal for production or staging control

This gives developers **intentional, secure deployment triggers** that don’t rely on automation alone.


### 🧠 Why This Workflow Structure Matters

Let’s unpack the *why* behind this structure — and why it’s the industry-preferred pattern for Docker-based pipelines.


#### ✅ 1. Separation of Concerns (Clarity & Modularity)

Each job does one thing: **test**, or **build/push**.

- Easier to debug — if tests fail, you don’t need to sift through push logs  
- Jobs can be rerun independently  
- Aligns with the idea of “stages” in a factory — testing shouldn’t happen after shipping


#### ✅ 2. Conditional Execution = Safety

- Jobs run in a **controlled order**  
- `build-and-push` depends on `test\

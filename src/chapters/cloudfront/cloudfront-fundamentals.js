In our last module, we took our first step into cloud development by deploying our Rock of Ages application to Amazon S3. You created a bucket, configured it for website hosting, and uploaded your React application files. By the end of that module, you had a working website accessible via your S3 bucket's website endpoint.

Today, we're going to enhance your cloud deployment with Amazon CloudFront. This addition will significantly improve your application's performance, security, and global accessibility.

## What We'll Accomplish Today

By the end of this module, your Rock of Ages application will be:
- Served through a global content delivery network
- Available with HTTPS security
- Optimized for speed with automatic file compression
- Ready to handle visitors from anywhere in the world

Let's start by understanding what CloudFront is and why it's valuable for your website.

## What is CloudFront?

The video below is a great introduction to AWS CloudFront service. Take time to watch the video but do not follow along. You will follow step-by-step instructions for creating your own distribution for the Rock of Ages client in the next chapter.

Amazon CloudFront is a **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** - a system of distributed servers that deliver web content to users based on their geographic location. 

Your S3 bucket stores your website's files in a single region (us-east-2/Ohio). Without CloudFront, every visitor to your site connects to that Ohio region to get your content, regardless of whether they're in California, Canada, or Croatia.

CloudFront improves this by creating copies of your website at "edge locations" around the world. Visitors connect to the edge location nearest to them, significantly reducing the distance (and time) it takes for your content to reach them.

## Why Your Website Benefits from CloudFront

Your S3 website is already working, so why add CloudFront? Here's why CloudFront transforms your basic S3 website into a professional, production-ready application:

### The Key Benefits of CloudFront

Let's examine how CloudFront specifically enhances your website:

**1. Improved Performance Through Proximity**

Without CloudFront, a user in Tokyo accessing your S3 bucket in Ohio experiences a significant delay as their request travels around the world and back. With CloudFront, that same user connects to a Tokyo edge location with minimal latency.

**Real-world example**: If a user in Tokyo and a user in New York both visit your website, the Tokyo user gets content from an Asian edge location while the New York user gets it from a North American edge location - both experiencing fast local performance even though your S3 bucket is only in the us-east-2 (Ohio) region.

**2. Content Caching**

CloudFront doesn't just provide a shorter path to your content - it also intelligently caches it:

- When the first user requests your homepage
- CloudFront retrieves it from your S3 bucket
- CloudFront stores (caches) a copy at the edge location
- When subsequent users request the same page, CloudFront serves it directly from the edge location
- Your S3 bucket handles fewer requests, improving efficiency and reducing costs

**3. Enhanced Security**

S3 website endpoints only support HTTP, which modern browsers flag as "Not Secure." CloudFront automatically provides HTTPS support, giving your site the security that users expect from professional websites.

**4. Global Reliability**

If a region experiences issues, CloudFront can route users to other healthy regions. This built-in redundancy helps maintain availability during certain types of AWS outages.

## How CloudFront Works with S3

Let's understand the relationship between CloudFront and your S3 bucket:

1. **S3 is the "origin"** - Your original content resides here
2. **CloudFront is the "distributor"** - It takes content from S3 and distributes it globally
3. **Edge locations are the "local delivery points"** - They store and serve copies of your content

When you set up CloudFront, you're creating a **distribution** - a configuration that tells CloudFront:
- Where to find your original content (your S3 bucket)
- How to handle different types of files
- How long to cache content before checking for updates
- Which edge locations should serve your content

## Key CloudFront Terminology

As we prepare to set up your distribution, let's familiarize ourselves with some key terms:

- **Distribution**: Your complete CloudFront configuration
- **Origin**: The source of your content (your S3 bucket)
- **Edge Location**: A data center where CloudFront caches your content
- **Cache Behavior**: Rules for how different file types are handled
- **TTL (Time To Live)**: How long files stay in cache before CloudFront checks for updates

These terms will make more sense as we go through the setup process in the next chapter.

## Why CloudFront Instead of Just S3?

You might be wondering: "If S3 already hosts my website, why add CloudFront?"

It's a legitimate question. S3 website hosting works well for development and testing, but has limitations for production websites:

- **Regional performance**: S3 website endpoints only serve from a single region
- **No HTTPS**: S3 website endpoints don't support secure connections
- **Limited optimization**: No built-in content compression or performance optimizations
- **Higher costs at scale**: Direct S3 access can be more expensive than CloudFront for high-traffic sites

S3 provides the storage foundation for your website, while CloudFront extends its reach and capabilities with a global delivery network.

## What We'll Do Next

In the next chapter, we'll:
1. Create a CloudFront distribution
2. Connect it to your S3 bucket
3. Configure settings for optimal performance
4. Access your website through its new CloudFront URL

By the end of these steps, your Rock of Ages application will be delivered through Amazon's global content delivery network - a significant improvement in performance, security, and professional deployment.

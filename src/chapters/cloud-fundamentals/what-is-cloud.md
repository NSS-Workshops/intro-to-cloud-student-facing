## Definition and Key Characteristics

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

Cloud computing explained in 2 minutes:

Key characteristics of cloud computing include:

- **On-demand self-service**: Users can provision computing capabilities as needed without requiring human interaction with service providers.
- **Broad network access**: Services are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms.
- **Resource pooling**: The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model.
- **Rapid elasticity**: Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released to scale rapidly with demand.
- **Measured service**: Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability.

## Cloud vs. Traditional Infrastructure

| Traditional Infrastructure | Cloud Infrastructure |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| High upfront capital expenditure | Pay-as-you-go operational expenditure |
| Fixed capacity | Elastic scaling |
| Long procurement cycles | Instant provisioning |
| Physical maintenance required | Managed by provider |
| Limited geographic reach | Global availability |
| Dedicated resources | Shared resources (multi-tenancy) |

## Types of Cloud Services

There are three main types of cloud services:

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Provides virtualized computing resources
- Examples: Virtual machines, storage, networks
- User manages: OS, middleware, applications
- Provider manages: Hardware, virtualization
- Use case: When you need complete control over your infrastructure

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Provides platform for developing, testing, and deploying applications
- Examples: App hosting, development tools, database management
- User manages: Applications, data
- Provider manages: Hardware, OS, middleware
- Use case: When you want to focus on application development without infrastructure concerns

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Provides ready-to-use applications over the internet
- Examples: Email services, CRM systems, office applications
- User manages: Data input and configuration
- Provider manages: Everything else
- Use case: When you need ready-made applications without development or hosting concerns

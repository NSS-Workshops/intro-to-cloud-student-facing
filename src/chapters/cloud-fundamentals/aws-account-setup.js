It includes access to the following AWS services:

- \`AmazonS3FullAccess\`
- \`CloudFrontFullAccess\`
- \`AmazonEC2FullAccess\`
- \`AmazonRDSFullAccess\`

> üö® **Please check in with your instructor before launching any resources outside of class.**  
> üßπ Don‚Äôt forget to **delete your resources** at the end of the course (your instructor will show you how!).  

> NSS will delete resources after the course is over ‚Äî **please do not expect anything to stick around**.  
> This is partly how we‚Äôre able to **keep this course free**.

## AWS Regions and Availability Zones

Understanding AWS's global infrastructure is crucial for designing resilient and performant applications.

Watch this short video about Regions and availability zones.

### Regions

A **Region** is a physical location around the world where AWS clusters data centers. Each region is completely independent and isolated from other regions.

Key points about regions:
- Currently, AWS has 34+ regions worldwide
- Each region has a name (e.g., us-east-1, eu-west-2)
- Not all services are available in all regions
- Data stored in a region stays in that region unless you explicitly move it
- Pricing can vary between regions

**How to choose a region**:
1. **Proximity to users**: Choose regions close to your target audience to reduce latency
2. **Service availability**: Ensure the services you need are available in your chosen region
3. **Compliance requirements**: Some regulations require data to be stored in specific geographic locations
4. **Pricing**: Costs can vary between regions

### Availability Zones

Each AWS Region consists of multiple, isolated locations called **Availability Zones** (AZs).

Key points about AZs:
- Each region has multiple AZs (typically 3-6)
- AZs are physically separated but connected with high-bandwidth, low-latency networking
- AZs are identified by letters (e.g., us-east-1a, us-east-1b)
- AZs allow you to build highly available applications by distributing resources across multiple zones

### Edge Locations

In addition to regions and AZs, AWS has **Edge Locations** that are part of Amazon CloudFront (Content Delivery Network).

- Edge locations are endpoints for AWS used for caching content
- Located in many more cities than regions (200+ edge locations globally)
- Help deliver content with lower latency to users worldwide

## Hands-on Exercise: Exploring the AWS Console

1. Log in to your AWS account 
2. Identify your current region in the top-right corner (use us-east-2 Ohio for the course)
3. Change to a different region and note any differences
4. Use the Services dropdown to navigate to the S3 service

In the next module, we'll dive deeper into AWS S3 and learn how to 
host a static website.

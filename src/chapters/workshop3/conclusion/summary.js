  ### What You Should Know
  
  By now, you should have some vocabulary and hands on experience that will be usefull during interviews with potential employers:
  
  1. **RDS**: [RDS Glossary](./rds-glossary)
  
  2. **Docker Networking**: [Docker Networking](./network-glossary)
  
  3. **Docker Compose**: [Docker Compose](TBA)
  
  
  ## Get Interview Ready!
  
  You should be able to answer some basic interview questions on the topics we have learned. For example:
  
  * What is RDS?
  * When would you use a relational database compared to other storage options?
  * What is Docker Networking?
  * What is Docker Compose?
  
  __Dont forget!__ ClaudeAI and ChatGPT are great resources to use when prepping for interviews. Here are some sample prompts: 
  
  * Give me a list of interview questions and answers for RDS
  * Can you ask each question one by one and evaluate my answers?
  
  Play around with different prompts to get more specific questions and answers about the services we have learned.

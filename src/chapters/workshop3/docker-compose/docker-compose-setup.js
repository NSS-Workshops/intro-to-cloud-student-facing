## Setting Up Your Project Structure

Let's organize your repositories properly for Docker Compose:

### Why Project Structure Matters

Docker Compose works best when all related services are organized under a single parent directory. This allows:
- Relative path references in the compose file
- Shared networks automatically
- Easy volume mounting for development
- Single command to manage everything

### Step 1: Create the Development Directory

\`\`\`bash
# Create a parent directory for your development environment
mkdir rock-of-ages-development
cd rock-of-ages-development
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Move Your Repositories

Move (don't copy) your existing repositories into this directory:

\`\`\`bash
# Move your API repository (use YOUR actual repo name)
mv ~/path/to/your/rock-of-ages-api ./

# Move your client repository (use YOUR actual repo name)
mv ~/path/to/your/rock-of-ages-client ./
\`\`\`

**Important**: Use your actual repository names! They might be:
- \`rock-of-ages-api-yourname\`
- \`yourname-rock-api\`
- etc.

Your structure should now look like:
\`\`\`
rock-of-ages-development/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ your-api-repo-name/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manage.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (other API files)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ your-client-repo-name/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (other client files)
\`\`\`

**Why this structure?** Docker Compose will use the parent directory as its "project" context, making it easy to reference both repositories and create a unified development environment.

## Creating Your Docker Compose File

### Step 3: Create docker-compose.yml

In the \`rock-of-ages-development\` directory, create a file named \`docker-compose.yml\`:

\`\`\`yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  # PostgreSQL Database Service
  postgres-db:
    image: postgres:15
    container_name: postgres-db
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: rockofages
      POSTGRES_USER: rockadmin
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: localpassword123
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U rockadmin -d rockofages"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

  # Django API Service
  api:
    build: 
      context: ./your-api-repo-name  # CHANGE THIS to your actual repo name
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: api-container
    env_file:
      - ./your-api-repo-name/.env.local  # CHANGE THIS to your actual repo name
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./your-api-repo-name:/app  # CHANGE THIS to your actual repo name
      - /app/.venv  # Preserve the virtual environment
    depends_on:
      postgres-db:
        condition: service_healthy
    command: pipenv run bash -c "./seed_database.sh && python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000"

  # React Client Service
  client:
    build:
      context: ./your-client-repo-name  # CHANGE THIS to your actual repo name
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: client-container
    env_file:
      - ./your-client-repo-name/.env.local  # CHANGE THIS to your actual repo name
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./your-client-repo-name:/app  # CHANGE THIS to your actual repo name
      - /app/node_modules
    command: npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000

volumes:
  postgres_data:

networks:
  default:
    name: rock-of-ages-network
\`\`\`

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: 
1. Replace \`your-api-repo-name\` with your actual API repository folder name (4 places)
2. Replace \`your-client-repo-name\` with your actual client repository folder name (4 places)
3. Make sure the PostgreSQL environment values match what's in your existing \`.env.local\` file!

**Notice the API command**: We're using the full Django startup command including database seeding. This means when you run \`docker compose up\`, you get a complete working application immediately!

### Step 4: Verify Your Environment Files

Before running Docker Compose, confirm that your \`.env.local\` files still exist from the previous section:

**Check your API's \`.env.local\` file:**

It should contain:
\`\`\`
DB_NAME=rockofages
DB_USER=rockadmin
DB_PASSWORD=localpassword123
DB_HOST=postgres-db
DB_PORT=5432
SSLMODE=disable
\`\`\`

**Check your client's \`.env.local\` file:**

It should contain:
\`\`\`
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
\`\`\`

**Critical**: The database values in your \`.env.local\` MUST match what you put in the docker-compose.yml file!

## Understanding the Docker Compose File

Let's break down what each section does and compare it to the manual commands you used before:

**version: '3.8'**
- Specifies the Docker Compose file format version
- Version 3.8 provides all modern features we need

**services:**
- Defines all containers that make up your application
- Each service can be built from a Dockerfile or use a pre-built image

**postgres-db service:**
- \`image: postgres:15\` - Uses the official PostgreSQL image
- **Previously**: You ran \`docker run -d --name postgres-db --network rock-of-ages-network -e POSTGRES_DB=rockofages -e POSTGRES_USER=rockadmin -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=localpassword123 -p 5432:5432 postgres:15\`
- **Now**: All those flags are organized clearly in the YAML file
- \`healthcheck:\` - Ensures database is ready before starting dependent services (NEW feature!)

**api service:**
- **Previously**: You ran \`docker build -t rock-of-ages-api .\` then \`docker run -d --name api-container --network rock-of-ages-network --env-file .env.local -p 8000:8000 rock-of-ages-api\`
- **Now**: Build and run configuration is declared in one place
- \`volumes:\` - **Game changer!** Your local code is mounted into the container
- \`depends_on:\` - Waits for database to be healthy before starting
- \`command:\` - Automatically seeds the database and starts Django server

**client service:**
- **Previously**: You built and ran with multiple commands
- **Now**: Everything is defined declaratively
- \`command:\` - This starts your React development server! When this runs, your app is live at localhost:3000

**Key Improvements Over Manual Setup**

1. **One Network**: No need to manually create with \`docker network create\`
2. **Automatic Building**: No separate \`docker build\` commands
3. **Health Checks**: Services wait for dependencies to be truly ready
4. **Volume Mounts**: **Game changer!** Live code synchronization enables hot reload
5. **Single Command**: Replace 10+ commands with just \`docker compose up\`

### The Magic of Volume Mounts

Volume mounts are what make hot reload possible:

\`\`\`yaml
volumes:
  - ./your-client-repo-name:/app  # Host code ‚Üí Container code (live sync)
  - ./your-api-repo-name:/app     # Host code ‚Üí Container code (live sync)
\`\`\`

**How this works:**
- **Edit a React file** on your host ‚Üí Volume mount reflects change in container ‚Üí Vite dev server detects change ‚Üí **Instant hot reload in browser!**
- **Edit a Python file** on your host ‚Üí Volume mount reflects change in container ‚Üí Django dev server detects change and restarts ‚Üí **New code is live immediately!**

**No rebuilding, no restarting containers, no waiting around** - just save and see your changes!

## Running Your Docker Compose Setup

### Step 5: Start Everything with One Command

Make sure you've verified your \`.env.local\` files exist (see Step 4), then:

\`\`\`bash
# From the rock-of-ages-development directory
docker compose up
\`\`\`

That's it! This single command:
- Creates the network automatically
- Builds images if needed  
- Starts all containers in the correct order
- Seeds your database with sample data
- Starts Django and React development servers
- Shows combined logs from all services

#### Expected Output

You should see output similar to this:
\`\`\`
[+] Running 4/4
 ‚†ø Network rock-of-ages-network        Created
 ‚†ø Container postgres-db               Started
 ‚†ø Container api-container             Started
 ‚†ø Container client-container          Started

postgres-db       | PostgreSQL init process complete; ready for start up.
postgres-db       | LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
api-container     | üîó Database connection: postgres-db:5432/rockofages
api-container     | üë§ Database user: rockadmin
api-container     | ‚úÖ Database setup complete!
api-container     | Django version 5.0.1, using settings 'rockproject.settings'
api-container     | Starting development server at http://0.0.0.0:8000/
api-container     | Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
client-container  | VITE v4.4.9  ready in 543 ms
client-container  | ‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
client-container  | ‚ûú  Network: http://0.0.0.0:3000/
\`\`\`

**‚úÖ Success indicators:**
- All containers show "Started"
- PostgreSQL: "ready to accept connections"
- API: "Starting development server at http://0.0.0.0:8000/"
- Client: "ready" and showing localhost:3000

**üéâ Congratulations!** You now have a complete full-stack application running with one command!

## Complete Application Testing

Let's verify that your entire full-stack application is working perfectly:

#### 1. Test the Database
In a new terminal (keep docker compose running):
\`\`\`bash
docker exec -it postgres-db psql -U rockadmin -d rockofages
\`\`\`

Run this query:
\`\`\`sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM rockapi_rock;
\`\`\`

You should see 3 rocks (from the seed data). Type \`\\q\` to exit.

#### 2. Test The Complete Application Flow
- **Open your browser** to \`http://localhost:3000\`
- **You should see** the Rock of Ages application
- **Open Developer Tools** and go to the **Network** tab
- **Try to register** a new user account
- **In the Network tab**, confirm that API calls are going to \`localhost:8000\`
- **Login** and try to view the rocks collection
- **Test adding** a rock to your collection  
- **Verify in Network tab** that all API requests show \`localhost:8000\` as the target

**üéâ If all tests pass, your complete Docker Compose environment is working perfectly!**

You now have a **full-stack development environment** that starts with a single command!

### Step 6: Test Hot Reload

Let's see Docker Compose hot reload in action:

1. **Open any React component** in your client repository (e.g., a component in \`src/components/\`)
2. **Make a visible change** - add some text or change a heading in the JSX
4. **Save the file**
5. **Check your browser** at \`http://localhost:3000\` - **The change appears instantly!**

**Why this works**: Docker Compose volume mounts (\`./your-client-repo-name:/app\`) sync your file changes immediately to the container, and Vite's dev server detects and hot reloads automatically.

### Step 7: Run in Background Mode (Optional)

If you prefer to run everything in the background without seeing the logs:

\`\`\`bash
docker compose up -d
\`\`\`

To see logs when running in background:
\`\`\`bash
docker compose logs -f
\`\`\`

To see logs for just one service:
\`\`\`bash
docker compose logs api -f
\`\`\`

### Useful Docker Compose Commands

Here are the most helpful commands with real-world scenarios:

**Stop everything:**
\`\`\`bash
docker compose down
\`\`\`
*When to use*: End of your work day, switching to a different project, or when you need to free up system resources.

**Rebuild images:**
\`\`\`bash
docker compose build
\`\`\`
*When to use*: After updating your Dockerfile, adding new dependencies to requirements.txt or package.json, or when Docker seems to be using an old cached version.

**Restart a specific service:**
\`\`\`bash
docker compose restart api
\`\`\`
*When to use*: The API crashed or is acting weird, you've made configuration changes that require a restart, or you want to clear the application's memory.

**View logs for a specific service:**
\`\`\`bash
docker compose logs client
docker compose logs api -f  # -f follows the logs in real-time
\`\`\`
*When to use*: Debugging why the React app won't compile, checking API error messages, or monitoring database queries.

**Run a command in a service:**
\`\`\`bash
# Run Django migrations after adding a new model
docker compose exec api pipenv run python manage.py makemigrations
docker compose exec api pipenv run python manage.py migrate

# Access the Django shell for debugging
docker compose exec api pipenv run python manage.py shell

# Install a new npm package in the client
docker compose exec client npm install axios

# Access the database directly
docker compose exec postgres-db psql -U rockadmin -d rockofages
\`\`\`
*When to use*: Running migrations after model changes, debugging data issues, adding new dependencies, or running one-off scripts.

**View running containers:**
\`\`\`bash
docker compose ps
\`\`\`
*When to use*: Checking which services are running, verifying all containers started successfully, or getting container names for other commands.
